## Scientific focus
**Host-pathogen-commensal interaction**; **Infection and Inflammation treatement**; **Cystic fibrosis**; **Immunology**;

**Functional genomics**; **Microbiome**; **Multi-omics data analysis**; 

**Virus genomic epidemiology and virus mutation surveillance**
## Currently running projects
**1. Investigation of commensal bacteria in controlling Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection** **(supported by funding from DFG and Mukoviszidose e.V.)**

**2. Emerging pathogens e.g. SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology and variants surveillance to precisely evaluate pandemic or post-pandemic conditions** **(supported by University Hospital and Medical Faculty Carl-Gustav-Carus)**

**3. Collabration projects with other teams by providing analyses with well-established methods, such as microbiome investigation, functional genomics analysis or deep sequencing data analysis**
## Methods
Both experimental approaches (e.g. Microbiology, Immunology methods) and computational biology/bioinformatics approaches are applied.

### Experimental approaches (both Mice and Human cells are used in the investigations):
**ex vivo organoid**: precision cut lung sclices (Mice)

**in vitro models**: BEAS-2B (Human bronchial epithelial cell line); BLaER1 (Human monocyte cell line); CFBE41o- (Human CF Bronchial Epithelial Cell Line)

**Microbiolgy/Virology methods**: growth rate assay; pathogenicity assay; metabolism assay; antibiotics resistance measurement; infection experiment; antibody neutrolization assay, and others.

**Immunology methods**: FACS analysis; qPCR; bead-based protein multiplex assay; ELISA; and others.

### Computational approaches:
**Functional genomic analysis** (in particular with a focus on bacterium and virus)

**Microbiome investigation** (experiment design, sequencing, and data analysis and interpretation)

**Transcriptome analysis** (differntial gene expression analysis, function enrichment analysis, master reguloar analysis, and other custimized anylysis based on specific reseach goals) - in Human,Mouse,and Bacterium

**Phylogenetic analysis** to decipher evolution relationship of differnet organisms, e.g. bacterium, virus, fungus

**Phylogeographic analysis and phylodynamic analysis** to investigate the spreading of certain pathogen, eg. bacterium, virus, fungus.

**Multi-omics data analysis**, incorporating omics data from diverse laysers, such as transcriptome, proteome, metabolome.

**Deep sequencing data analysis for CRISPR experiment**, e.g. library establishement, choosing of postive clones.
