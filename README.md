## Scientific focus
**Host-pathogen-commensal interaction**; **Infection and Inflammation treatement**; **Immunology**;**Cystic fibrosis**;

**Functional genomics**; **Microbiome**; **Immunology**; **Multi-omics data analysis**; 

**Virus genomic epidemiology and virus mutation surveillance**
## Currently running projects
**1. Investigation of commensal bacteria in controlling Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection** **(supported by funding from DFG and Mukoviszidose e.V.)**

**2. Emerging pathogens e.g. SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology and variants surveillance to precisely evaluate pandemic or post-pandemic conditions** **(supported by University Hospital and Medical Faculty Carl-Gustav-Carus)**

**3. Collabration projects with other teams by providing analyses with well-established methods, such as microbiome investigation, functional genomics analysis or deep sequencing data analysis**
## Methods
Both experimental approaches (e.g. Microbiology, Immunology methods) and computational biology/bioinformatics approaches are applied.

### Experimental approaches:
**ex vivo organoid**: precision cut lung sclices (Mice)

**in vitro models**: BEAS-2B (Human bronchial epithelial cell line); BLaER1 (Human monocyte cell line); CFBE41o- (Human CF Bronchial Epithelial Cell Line)

**Other approaches**: FACS analysis, bacterial growth monitoring; antibiotics resistance measurement; qPCR; bead-based protein multiplex assay; ELISA and others
